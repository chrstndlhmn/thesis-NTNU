# PhD thesis

This is the latex code for the PhD thesis of Christian Dalheim Øien. It is based on the CoPCSE@NTNU – Community of Practice for Computer Science Education at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology – LaTeX thesis template from https://github.com/COPCSE-NTNU/bachelor-thesis-NTNU and https://github.com/COPCSE-NTNU/master-theses-NTNU.

Changes to the template:
- Latin Modern font (standard LaTeX font)
- b5 page size, font size 11
- Odd and even numbered pages with margins: inner=2.5cm, outer=2cm, top=2cm, bottom=2.5cm
- Odd-numbered pages have header 'chapter title' and 'page number'. Even-numbered pages have header 'page number'.
- Scale 0.78 for included pdf pages gives a bit better margins than default
